# DonkBot The DiscordBot
Readme and bot are very rough only use if you have basic skills in github and docker.  
docker image - https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/nalinhue/donkbot/general  
-play or -p to play a song based of a title not a link yet.  
-skip of -s to skip to the next song.  
-cease or -c to stop playing completely.  
-queue of -q to list the queue.  
The bot will tell you off if you diddnt type your command in a discord channel with music in its name.  
The bot will use youtube to autoplay a song based of the title of the last song when playback finishes.
